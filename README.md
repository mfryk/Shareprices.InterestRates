Tableau Shareprices Interest Rates

To open file copy the the .twbx file code and open in Tableau Public. 

My goal was to show the relationship between Stock Prices (The S&P500) and Federal Reserve Interest rates, to see if there was a correlation between increased interest rates and a higher stock price.

There are 2 visualiations, one is a double line graph showing the S&P500 score and change in interest rates.

The second shows the daily return % of the S&P500 against the Interest rate
